# ToDo-with-MockAPI

# Project Setup and Run Guide

## Project Overview
This project is a dynamic and aesthetic To-Do List WebApp with separate HTML pages for the Login, Sign Up, and the To-Do List itself. The project uses Bootstrap for styling, SweetAlert2 for alerts, and fetches data from the MockAPI service for user authentication and task management.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into three main HTML files:
- `index.html` (Login Page)
- `signup_Page.html` (Sign Up Page)
- `todo_window.html` (To-Do List WebApp)

The CSS folder includes styling files for each page, and the JS folder contains JavaScript files for handling functionality.
